# Titanic - data science project 

## INTRODUCTION
This is simple data science project designed to predict whether a given person would survive the Titanic crash.

It is not a ready-made project, but a starting point for You. It has been written without respecting good practices.

We have come up with 9 tasks for you related to this project. Try to do them all in best possible way. Do not quit if you fail to complete all tasks. We would like to see your project, even if it is only partially ready.

Project is written in python, as it is the most usefull to work with us. However, if you are ninja in other language, and want to show off your skills, you can rewrite the code to other language.

## TASKS
Below you will find 9 tasks. Start from the first one. Further tasks can be done in any order you like and it is fine if you skip some of them.

### TASK1 - organizational instructions
 Create your own repository on Github or other public code versioning server. Use content of this project to create initial commit.
 
 Follow the rules:
* The solutions to all subsequnt tasks should be in your repository.
* Each task should be solved in separate branch using any number of commits. You can edit the code or add additional file explaining your way of thinking. The branch name should be related to the task, so we can know which branch applies to which task.
* All branches should finally be merged to master branch.
* At the end remember to share your repository with us.

### TASK2 - sense of humour
Add a file with your favourite joke to the docs directory.

### TASK3 - good practices
* Correct the code so it is easy to read, run and reuse.
* Remember about
  * README.md files
  * Code comments
  * quality and performance of code -- remove or fix badly written code

### TASK4 - feature engineering
Propose better solution for feature engineering than the one given by us.

### TASK5 - models
Propose other prediction models than the one proposed by us. 

### TASK6 - measures
After completing TASK5, justify why you have chosen this particular model. Compare it with the model proposed by us or with any other model choosen by you. If you haven't completed TASK5, write theoretically how can you compare two solutions.

### TASK7 - docker
Prepare a Dockerfile that will allow us to run your code in the container.

### TASK8 - tests
Write unit tests covering your code.

### TASK9 - prediction api
Prepare a code that will share your model via API. It should be accessible by the HTTP protocol and accept and return data in JSON format

## GOOD LUCK!!!
