# Titanic Assessment Project

This repository contains multiple tasks on the Titanic dataset. To see the instructions for each task got to [this document](docs/TASKS.md).


## Branch-specific comments:
To run the code, execute 'python src/pipeline.py' in the terminal from the ROOT of the repo. This will prepare the dataset, train the model, evaluate it and print the metrics.

### Side-note
The current form of the code is not perfect, I decided to correct and improve the given code, rather than rewriting and reorganizing it completely.
