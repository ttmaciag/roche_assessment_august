# Titanic Assessment Project

This repository contains multiple tasks on the Titanic dataset. To see the instructions for each task got to [this document](docs/TASKS.md).


## Branch-specific comments:
To test the code run: 'pytest src/tests'.
The test files (test_dataset.csv, test_target.csv, test_model) are not uploaded to github, it would be better to use gitLFS for that.
