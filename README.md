# Titanic Assessment Project

This repository contains multiple tasks on the Titanic dataset. To see the instructions for each task got to [this document](docs/TASKS.md).


## Branch-specific comments:
In addition to running one of the models ('random_forest', 'gbdt', 'svc') with 'python src/pipline.py', you can also run all three models with 'python src/pipline_multi_model.py'. 

The first script is more useful for tunning the hyper-parameters, while the second for comparing the models.
